A batch file for automatically connecting to an MS VPN. Designed to be used as a Startup script.

The script will connect only if you're not already on the "remote" LAN. Good for laptops that are always working, but only sometimes inside the office.

Recommendations for the VPN profile to which you connect:

Disable two settings:

- Display progress while connecting

- Prompt for name and password, certificate, etc
